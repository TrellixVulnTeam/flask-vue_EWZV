## Low-level Environment Setup

In this file, I am planning to document all low-level environment setups for this project, such as importing libraries, setting up configs, and other relevant processes.

### As of September 21, 2019, my TODO is:

* utilizing session in flask
* defining config dictionary, and storing them in webapp_settings
* installing Vue-storage to store data on client side


### Other things that I am considering at this point:

* having cloud on server (for data uploads and retrievation?)
* having a server (AWS? Firebase? Free one?)
* deviding development and production, with their own databases, servers, etc.
